This is a janky scraper for Andro's Rostilj, which is unfortunately a Wix site and therefor annoying to scrape. Theoretically, you would use this code to power your various Slackbots and whatnot.

To install dependencies:

```
pip install bs4
pip install requests
```

Then run:

```
python main.py
```

Don't `@` me, thanks.
